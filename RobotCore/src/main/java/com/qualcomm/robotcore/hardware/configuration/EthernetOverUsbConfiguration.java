/*
 * Configuration for a device that implements Ethernet over USB.
 *
 * Assumptions for vendors that implement this class of device:
 *
 * Devices that implement this should also implement a DHCP server.  When connected to a USB
 * port on the Control Hub, Android will create an ethernet interface, typically eth0, but maybe eth1,
 * and the device should, via DHCP, assign the Control Hub an ip address.
 *
 * The "serial number" in the configuration is the ip address assigned to the Control Hub.  For this
 * reason, devices should take care that the ip address allocated via DHCP is persistent between reconnects.
 *
 * An example of how this may be accomplished would be for the DHCP server to allocate an ip address that is
 * a fixed offset from the device's own ip address.
